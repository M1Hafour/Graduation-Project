# Wheat Diseases Detection Mopile Application

## Intro

My graduation project,is a mobile application aimed at providing a fast and accurate tool for farmers and researchers to identify and manage wheat diseases.
ou project focused on detecting the inficted parts of the plant and show the user the diseas type.
The primary objectives of the project are to provide a fast and accurate tool for wheat disease detection, reduce crop losses due to diseases, and increase wheat crop productivity and quality.

## Paper & Dataset Description

We only worked on 4 diseases[powdery-mildew, septoria, stemrust, yellow-rust] with total images 1885 image

## Methodology 
we used Instance Segmentation with roboflow wep app

## detection Methods
We used different machine learning methods such as Decision Tree, Random forest. 
we used  different customized CNN architectures.

## Deployment
we used Mopile application to capture images to the wheat and send it to the model then the model try to predict if that wheat plant is infected or not if it's infecte then it
allocated the diseas by the sigmentation and write what is the diseas.
